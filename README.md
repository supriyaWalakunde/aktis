# ArktisCustomValidation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

## To Run the project

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Approach

I have used a template driven form with a single input field.
Created a Angular custom directive named PageValidatorDirective which implements Validator interface, then used this directive in the input field to perform the custom validation.
